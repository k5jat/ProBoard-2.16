ProBoard Key Generator
----------------------

Sysop Name            - Name of the sysop as set in ProCFG/Options/Site
                        Info

BBS Name              - Name of the BBS as set in ProCFG/Options/Site Info

Alpha Test            - Allow alpha-testing (don't set this for regular
                        beta sites)

Beta Test             - Allow beta-testing (set this for regular beta
                        sites)

Gamma Test            - Allow gamma-testing (set this for regular beta
                        sites)

Distr. Site           - Key for a distribution site (official ProBoard
                        distributors)

Registr. Site         - Key for registration sites.  Should not be set by
                        regional registration sites.

Commercial            - Commercial registration. Yes/No

Expiration Date       - Key expires on this date (only use to issue
                        temporary keys).  Format DD/MM/YY

Expiration Version    - Version number for which the key should no longer
                        work.  Leave this to "0.00" for normal keys and
                        "0.00" for commercial keys.


After you press [Esc] to exit the key generator, a key will be placed in
the current directory (REGKEY.PB).

The file GENKEY.RND should be located in the same directory as the key
generator EXE file. (it is required to run the key generator)


Note: When zipping up the key for someone, make sure you don't accidently
      zip up the key generator with it.  I've had it happen! :-)
      So make sure you do "PKZIP <zipname> REGKEY.PB" instead of
      "PKZIP <zipname>" (because that will default to *.*).  DANGEROUS!

!! -> A better way (and I would like to ask you all to follow this
      rule!!) is to start the key generator from a directory where the key
      generator is NOT located.
      For example, place the key generator in C:\PBKEYGEN and run it from
      C:\TMP with the following command line: C:\PBKEYGEN\GENKEY.EXE
