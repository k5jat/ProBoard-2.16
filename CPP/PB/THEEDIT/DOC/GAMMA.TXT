MainTitle   : A Gamma version
Paragraph   :
{
    Since a few weeks, the beta testers listed below and me are working and
    testing several beta's of TheEdit 2.00. I think the product is now stable
    enough to be released as a gamma.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³    To make this document easy to read, new paragraphs will be marked with the
³   '³' character at the left.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    You should be aware of a few things:
}

Paragraph   :
{
    1) It is still a product that is not fully tested. Some (small) problems
       may still exist.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   2) Beta versions are for the members of the beta crew, Gamma versions may
³      be used by every ProBoard beta tester. Unlike ProBoard (where the gamma
³      versions are almost the same as the final release), TheEdit can have
³      some new features in every new gamma. You should tread gamma versions
³      more like world-wide beta released.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    3) TheEdit is tested under ProBoard 2.02á and compiled with the SDK for
       ProBoard 2.02. It may not work with versions prior to 2.02á.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    4) As for most programs, the final documentation is written after the
       program is ready. The included documentation is the one for TheEdit
       1.01.  There are a lot of things changed, so read the GAMMA.DOC
       carefully!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    5) Every beta tester of ProBoard 2.02 may test TheEdit 2.00 gamma
       releases, even the sysops that are not registered to TheEdit, but some
       small features are not available in the unregistered version. I'm not
       gonna enable them in gamma releases, so if you're not registered and
       you don't want to test a program if it's not fully functional than
       don't do it.
}


MainTitle   : Beta Testers
Paragraph   :
{
    The sysops below are in my beta testers team. I would like to thank them
    for the support and the idea's. I also would like to thank my son, Tim,
    for keeping his fingers from my RESET button ;-)
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Jim Biggs           ( The O-Zone BBS    )
    Philippe Leybaert   ( Home Of ProBoard  )
    Peter Hampf         ( Granny's Inn      )
    Tim De Meyer        ( MultiNet HomeBase )
    Constantin Spiess   ( Dealer's          )
}

MainTitle   : What's new
Paragraph   :
{
    You can find all changes since the last version in this section of the
    document.
}

SubTitle    : Changed since gamma 2
Paragraph   :
{
³   (AS)    New variable in the INI file:
³
³           [GENERAL]
³           Printer    = LPT1
}

Paragraph   :
{
³           The sysop can use the ALT-P key to print the message to the
³           printer specified in the INI file.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   (AS)    Warning! The language file is changed. Don't forget to add a line
³           for the "Binary characters found" prompt. See the example language
³           files.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   (AS)    After Import or Upload, TheEdit will check the temporary buffer
³           (containing the imported file) if there are binary characters in
³           it (valid characters are >= 32 or 13, 10, 9, 26 for the technical
³           people).  If there are binary characters, the file will not be
³           imported.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   (AS)    The German language, header and help file are now included.
³           Thanks Constantin!
}

SubTitle    : Bugfixes since gamma 2
Paragraph   :
{
³           The previous version of TheEdit was checking the carrier, even
³           when the sysop was using TheEdit in local mode. The result was
³           that sysops using OS/2 had a conflict. Fixed!
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   (PH)    #&%?#@?$#@ (sorry...). A few minutes after gamma 2 was hatched,
³           we found out that the ^T, ^LEFT and ^RIGHT are still not working
³           as it should be. Fixed now (I hope).
}

SubTitle    : Changes since gamma 1
Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    Changed some code in the editor object so that it can be used for
            TheChat 2.00.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    The textmacro's you can use in the language file and banner line
            are now translated on the fly. So, if you use the @<TIME>@ or
            other macros with changing values, they will be updated everytime
            the screen is updated.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    When pressing a ALT-Fx key, TheEdit will check if there's a file
            linked with the key. If not, TheEdit will get the sysop-macro
            defined in ProCFG. If the macro is a "display" macro (if macro
            starts with a ` character), the macro will be copied in the
            message window at the current cursor position. For example, you
            can define the string "`||CUL8R|@<SYSOPNAME>@||" to a macro.
            TheEdit will translate this macro to "<enter><enter>CUL8R
            <enter><your full name>".
}

SubTitle    : Bugfixes since gamma 1
Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    A bug in the wordwrap routine could cause the screen layout to be
            destroyed and in some circumstances, the program will end in an
            endless loop (hanging your system...). This happened when there
            were a few lines with large words to wrap. Fixed!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (PH)    Pressing ^T at the last word would lockup the system. In fact,
            TheEdit was in an endless loop (searching for the next
            character...). Fixed! Thanks, Peter!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (PH)    Pressing ^LEFT and ^RIGHT didn't work as it should be. Fixed!
}

SubTitle    : Known bugs
Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    In local mode, the ProBoard status bar isn't update. Due to the
            fact that almost no default SDK code is used in local mode,
            ProBoard doesn't update the status line.
}

SubTitle    : Changes since the last beta
Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    You can now use the TEXT MACRO'S in the BANNERTEXT and LANGUAGE
            FIELDS. You can find an example in the included language files.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    Added new function: DELETE WORD (^T key)
}

Paragraph   :
{
    (AS)    There is a help screen, but most users don't use it. I've seen a
            few users deleting whole screens with the DEL key instead of using
            CTRL-Y to delete a whole line. Therefore, I've added a shortcut
            for the help (CTRL-N) and added it in the included headers. Don't
            blame me if they don't use it...
}

SubTitle    : bugfixes
Paragraph   :
{
    (PH)    There was a bug in the function to parse the language file.
            Therefore, the comment separator is changed from "/*" to ";"
}

MainTitle   : The history
Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit 1.00 was the first available message editor as a PEX. It had a lot
    of functions still not found in any other editor.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    There were some things that could be better. Users asked me for a better
    layout, multi language support, more functions and more speed.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit 2.00 has it all. It is completely rewritten from scratch, using
    highly optimized C++ and assemble code. Even with the extra functions,
    TheEdit 2.00 is about 20Kb smaller than 1.01!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    The multi-language support is very easy to use. Every prompt on the screen
    can be translated in any language you wish. Even the header and help
    screens can be translated.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Due to the use of highly optimized assemble code for the critical parts in
    TheEdit, the editor is much faster than 1.xx
}

Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit uses also optimized screen code depending on the terminal mode you
    (or the user) using.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    If you are using TheEdit in local mode, all screen output is handled by
    Direct Video Ram Access (fully desqview aware!).  Depending on the remote
    terminal mode (ANSI or AVATAR), TheEdit will send different terminal
    commands to the user his terminal program to scroll the screen, move the
    cursor, change the color, ...
}

Paragraph   :
{
    An example? If your user is using AVATAR and is in 50-lines mode,
    scrolling one line up means that +/- 44 lines (50 - header) needs to be
    redrawed. TheEdit will send only 11 bytes to the terminal program and the
    scrolling will be handled by the user his terminal program! In other
    situations, programs should send the 44 lines back to the terminal
    program.  If every line has something around 50 characters, that would be
    +/- 3 Kb (cursor and color codes included). Can you imagine how fast
    scrolling is handled in Avatar mode ?
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Editor like FullEdit and NSDEdit (witch used the code from FullEdit, it
    has the same bugs...) need to constantly (after every keystroke) update
    the cursor position. Depending on the terminal mode, this means that for
    every character you type, these editors will send between 5 and 10
    characters to the modem.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit remembers the last cursor position and uses optimized code to
    change it. In most situations, only one character is send to the modem
    after a keystroke!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Unlike TheEdit 1.x and the other editors, TheEdit 2.00 has no default
    layout. The header displayed at the top of the screen is a ANSI file witch
    can be modified with programs like TheDraw.
}

MainTitle   : What's new in 2.00
Paragraph   :
{
    *   TheEdit is completely rewritten from scratch, using highly-optimized
        C++ and assembly code, that produced a smaller and faster PEX file.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   Multi language support! TheEdit 2.00 will detect the language used
        by the user and try to find the TheEdit control files for this
        language. All prompts can be translated in any language. Even the
        help screen can be translated.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   New quote system. TheEdit 2.00 has two quote systems: the
        GoldEd-alike (complete original message quoted and the user has to
        remove the lines he don't need) and a quote window (original
        message in another window and the user has to select the lines he
        wants in his answer).
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   TheEdit can now be used to edit other files than messages. A user
        asked my to add code to import a ASCII file, let the user edit it and
        print it to the printer when he/she saves it. You can use the command
        line parameters to specify the file TheEdit should load when it is
        started and the filename it should use to save the text to.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   The messagebuffer in TheEdit 1.xx was only limited by the available
        memory. In some situations, ProBoard had troubles saving large
        messages (due to some problems in the original Squish API code).
        TheEdit 2.00 has a 32K limit for the messages.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   TheEdit has a very fast WordWrap function. If you look in the source
        code from the FullEdit editor's toolkit, the author writes that his
        WordWrap function is the bottleneck of his program (and believe me,
        it is!).  TheEdit uses an optimized piece of assemble code to perform
        the WordWrap.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   User-definable layout. You can change the layout for TheEdit as you
        like it. All colors can be redefined. Even the header at the top op
        the screen can be redefined.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   Enhanced import system. You can link up to 10 files to your ALT-Fxx
        keys. Pressing such a key will import the linked files in the message
        window.  Great for default answers on frequently asked questions.
}

MainTitle   : Installation
Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit is very easy to install. The best way is to create a directory for
    TheEdit (i.e. \Pb\Pex\TheEdit\) and unpack the archive in that directory.
    Then, change the path to the external message editor in ProCFG:

        Editor Cmd: @\Pb\Pex\TheEdit\TheEdit.Pex

    That's all!
}

MainTitle   : Incompatibility with quoters
Paragraph   :
{
    There are some PEX'es available to add a one-line quote at the end of
    every message. Most of them don't support PEX message editors. For that
    reason, you can't use ProTag together with TheEdit. There is nothing I
    can do about it, the author of ProTag has to change his code to fix this
    bug.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    One of my other PEX'es, TheQuote, has the same functions as ProTag, and
    has more than 7.000 quotes. TheQuote (starting from 1.10) fully support
    TheEdit and other PEX message editors. TheQuote is freeware software!
}

MainTitle   : The configuration file
Paragraph   :
{
    As in most of my other PEX'es, TheEdit uses the domain principe in the
    configuration file to keep is easy to understand and to manage.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    This section will describe the configuration file for TheEdit 2.00. The
    text between brackets is de default value for the described variable.
}

SubTitle    : [General] domain
Paragraph   :
{
    StopBanner  =  Yes/No       In registered version, you can stop the
                                banner at the bottom of the screen. If you
    (No)                        choose to stop the banner, you can still
                                switch between all the lines in the banner by
                                pressing ALT-B (b = banner).
}

Paragraph   :
{
    FastScroll  =  Yes/No       FastScroll will scroll the text a whole
                                window when to top or bottom of the screen
    (Yes)                       is reached. This will speed-up the screen in
                                ANSI mode. FastScroll is always disabled in
                                LOCAL or AVATAR mode, because it isn't needed
                                in these modes.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    InsertMode  = On/Off        Set Insert-mode at startup ON or OFF. In
                                insert mode, text will be inserted at the
    (On)                        current cursor position.  In overwrite mode,
                                the text at the current cursor position will
                                be overwritten by the new characters you type.
                                Here you specify the startup value. Once you
                                are in TheEdit, you can choose between INSERT
                                and OVERWRITE with the INSERT or ^V key.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    FullQuote   = On/Off        If FullQuote is enabled, a user can choose to
                                use the GoldEd-style quoting system (described
    (On)                        in this documentation).  When replying to a
                                message, the user can select to import the
                                whole quote in the message or to use a quote
                                window. When FullQuote is disabled, the quote
                                is always loaded in the quote window.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    BannerText  = ...           If the banner is enabled (StopBanner = No),
                                the information displayed at the bottom of the
    (no default)                screen is changed every 30 sends. In this
                                variable, you can add one line for the banner.
                                You can use the ProBoard text macro's (like
                                @<FIRSTNAME>@) too.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   Printer     = ...           The sysop can use the ALT-P key to print the
³                               contents of the message buffer to the
³   (no default)                specified printer.  Only the text is printed
³                               (not the header of the message).
}

SubTitle    : [Shareware] domain
Paragraph   :
{
    RegisterKey = ...           TheEdit is a shareware product, so you have to
                                register it if you want to use it after the
    (no default)                30-days evaluation period.  When we received
                                your registration form and the money, the
                                registration site will send you a message like
                                this:
}

Paragraph   :
{
    To register TheEdit, you will have to add the following two lines to your
    TheEdit.Ini configuration file:

    [Shareware]
    RegisterKey = 45424D29235D4D5842204653112B6F11716

    Note:   This registration key is created for the following site informa-
    =====   tion. If this is not the same as you've specified in ProCFG, it
            won't work!

            The site information is not case sensitive.

                Sysop name ...: <your name here>
                BBS name .....: <your BBS name>


    Thank you for your support!
}

Paragraph   :
{
                                Follow the instructions in the message and you
                                will have a registered version.
}

SubTitle    : [ImportFiles] domain
Paragraph   :
{
    ALT-F1      = <filename>    You can link a filename to a ALT-Fxx function
    ...                         key. Whenever the sysop is using TheEdit in
    ALT-F10                     local mode, he/she can press the ALT-Fxx key
    (no default)                to import the file.
}

SubTitle    : Coordinates
Paragraph   :
{
    As stated at the beginning of this document, you can change the layout
    completely. TheEdit has to know the coordinates for the data fields and
    editor part. The following domains let you specify these coordinates.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Please note that:

    - the upper/left corner of the screen is 0/0, not 1/1!
    - there are NO defaults for these fields, so if you don't include the
      definitions for these fields in your configuration file, you will have
      an empty header, no colors and no text window!
}

SubTitle    : [TextWindow] domain
Paragraph   :
{
    Row         = 5             The Y coordinate where TheEdit should
                                start the editor part. Remember that
                                coordinates start at 0, so 5 means the
                                6th line!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    ForeGround  = +White        Here, you can specify the foreground color
                                for the normal text. You can use the full
                                english name of the color (BLACK, BLUE,
                                GREEN, RED, CYAN, MAGENTA, BROWN and WHITE).
                                To use the highlighted equivalent of the
                                color, add a '+' sign at the start of the
                                name. So, use +BROWN if you want to use
                                YELLOW.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    BackGround  = Black         Here, you can specify the background color
                                for the normal text.

                                To use the blinking equivalent of the
                                foreground color, you must add the '+' sign to
                                the background. Seems not so logical, but
                                that's the same way the BIOS and VIDEORAM
                                works.

                                So, if you specify FOREGROUND = +RED and
                                BACKGROUND = +CYAN, you will get
                                highlighted-blinking-red characters on a
                                CYAN background.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    QForeGround = +Magenta      This is the foreground used for quote text.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    QBackGround = Black         This is the background used for quote text.
}

SubTitle    : [MenuBar] domain
Paragraph   :
{
    ForeGround  = Black         This is the foreground used for the menubar.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    BackGround  = White         This is the background used for the menubar
}

SubTitle    : Datafields
Paragraph   :
{
    Every data field (from, to, subject, ...) has his own domain where you
    can specify the X and Y coordinates, length and color. These are the
    supported domains:

    [From]       : Message 'From' data field    (name of the user           )
    [To]         : Message 'To' data field      (name of the recipient      )
    [Subject]    : Message 'Subject' field
    [Area]       : Message 'Area' field         (name of the message area   )
    [MsgNumber]  : Message 'Number' field       (the number of the message  )
    [PrivateMsg] : Message 'Private' field      (Private message? YES or NO )
    [InsertMode] : Editor 'Insert' mode         (in INSERT or OVERWRITE mode)
    [RawKeys]    : Editor 'Raw' mode            (in RAW or NORMAL mode      )
    [EscForMenu] : 'Press ESC for menu' prompt
}

SubTitle    : [ROW] variable
Paragraph   :
{
    Row         = 0             This is the row (Y coordinate) where TheEdit
                                will write the data for the current field.
                                Remember that coordinates start at 0,0!
}

SubTitle    : [COLUMN] variable
Paragraph   :
{
    Column      = 0             This is the column (X coordinate) where
                                TheEdit will write the data for the current
                                field.
}

SubTitle    : [LENGTH] variable
Paragraph   :
{
    Length      = 14            This is the maximum size TheEdit should use
                                to display the current field. Use this to
                                make sure TheEdit won't overwrite text in your
                                header. If you want to disable a field, set
                                this to '0' (zero)
}

SubTitle    : [FOREGROUND] variable
Paragraph   :
{
    see 'ForeGround' in the EDITWINDOW domain.
}

SubTitle    : [BACKGROUND] variable
Paragraph   :
{
    see 'BackGround' in the EDITWINDOW domain.
}

SubTitle    : Example configuration file
Paragraph   :
{
    You will find an example configuration file in the archive. This is the
    configuration file as I use it.
}

MainTitle   : Multi-Language support
Paragraph   :
{
    As far as I know, TheEdit is the first message editor for ProBoard that
    supports multi-language. You can (but don't have to) redefine every prompt
    in every language you which.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Unlike ProBoard, TheEdit doesn't use binary language files. The language
    file is a pure ASCII file with the language as basename and .LNG as
    extension.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Whenever TheEdit is starter, it will try to load the <language>.LNG file
    (i.e. DUTCH.LNG). If the file doesn't exist, it will load the THEEDIT.LNG
    file (english prompts). Please note that there are no defaults, so if
    there's no language file, TheEdit won't run!
}

SubTitle    : Format of the language file
Paragraph   :
{
    As described above, the language file is a pure ASCII file, with one line
    for every prompt. All prompts should be defined, because there are no
    defaults.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    You can include comments in the language file. Comment lines should start
    with the ';' character, unless the comment is added after a prompt. In
    that case, you should place a ";" between the prompt and the comment.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    You can't change the order of the prompts in the language file, unless you
    want the wrong prompts on the wrong places ;-)
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Even the menubar can be redefined. The hotkey for every option should be
    between brackets ([]). TheEdit will display the hotkey in uppercase.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Be sure that the redefined menu-items fit on one line. TheEdit doesn't
    check the length of the items and will overwrite parts of the screen is
    the line is too long!
}

SubTitle    : Example language file
Paragraph   :
{
    You can find two examples in the archive: THEEDIT.LNG (the default
    prompts) and DUTCH.LNG (but the registrations site of your country may
    have changed this).
}

MainTitle   : Header and Help files
Paragraph   :
{
    As you already know, the header at the top of the screen and the help file
    can be redefined. As for the language file, TheEdit will try to load
    <language>.HED as the header and <language>.HLP as the help file. If the
    file for that language doesn't exist, TheEdit will load the default ones
    (TheEdit.Hed and TheEdit.Hlp).
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Please not that unlike TheEdit 1.xx, these text files should be in the
    TheEdit directory, not in the TEXT directory!
}

Paragraph   :
{
    There are a few rules for the header file:
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   Make it as small as possible. The less lines you use for your
        header, the more lines there are available for the editor.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   Don't use the full 80 characters width. Some terminal programs will
        wrap the cursor and TheEdit will screw up.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    *   Don't add clear-screen codes to the ANSI file. If you use TheDraw,
        save it with "Home Cursor" codes instead of "Clear screen".
}

MainTitle   : What is RAW mode?
Paragraph   :
{
    ProBoard uses the cursor keys (together with the CONTROL key) to change
    the user's level and online time. The PageUp, PageDown and Home keys are
    used to scroll the banner.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit uses these keys too for the word-processing actions. Due to that,
    you can't change a user's level or time if TheEdit is started.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    To make these functions available, TheEdit 2.00 has a so called RAW mode.
    That is the mode that TheEdit won't handle the special keys from the
    sysop's keyboard. So, if you are using TheEdit in RAW mode, you can use
    the cursor keys to change the level and time and the PageUp/PageDown keys
    to scroll banner (ProBoard status line) at the bottom of the screen.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    Once TheEdit is started, you can toggle between RAW and NORMAL mode with
    the ALT-K (K = KEYBOARD) key.
}

Paragraph   :
{
    TheEdit will startup in NORMAL mode is you are using TheEdit locally. If a
    user is starting TheEdit, it will startup in RAW mode.
}

MainTitle   : Command line parameters
Paragraph   :
{
³   You can specify the default LOAD and SAVE name (not IMPORT and EXPORT!)
³   for TheEdit. The LOAD filename is the file loaded when TheEdit starts. The
³   SAVE filename is the name used for the file when the user selects the SAVE
³   function.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   Using this technique makes it possible to use a text the user should fill
³   in and print it when the user selects the SAVE function.
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   In the next chapter, you will find the information about the command line
³   parameters. TheEdit doesn't need any parameter to run in the default mode.
³   You can use both parameters on the same command line.
}

SubTitle    : -L parameter
Paragraph   :
{
³   Specify -L <filename> (note the space between the parameters!) on the
³   commandline to force TheEdit to load <filename> when it starts up.
³
³   example: -L REGFORM.TXT
}

SubTitle    : -S parameter
Paragraph   :
{
³   Specify -S <filename> on the commandline to force TheEdit to save the
³   textbuffer as <filename>. You can use the name of a file or a device (i.e.
³   LPT1:)
³
³   example: -S LPT1:
}

Paragraph   :
{
³   Warning: It is your responsibility that the file can be created. If you
³   use LPT1: and there's no paper in the printer, your system can hang (Paper
³   out, A)bort - R)etry - I)gnore at the DOS prompt). TheEdit doesn't check
³   this at all!
}
