         One note about the difference between the commercial and
         non-commercial (personal) registration: non-commercial (personal)
         registrations are ONLY for individuals who run a BBS as a HOBBY.
         Registrations for all other BBSs require a commercial
         registration.  Commercial registration prices are EXCLUDING local
         taxes (VAT/TVA/BTW/...)

         To register, print the registration form REGFORM.TXT, fill it out,
         and send it together with your payment to one of the registration
         sites listed in the manual.

         If you want to register by transferring money to any of the
         ProBoard accounts in Europe, be certain you don't forget to mail a
         registration form to the address listed along with the account
         number, or you can upload/FAX it to the registration site for your
         area.  We can not and will not be responsible for any money
         received without a registration form.
