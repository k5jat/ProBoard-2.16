============================================================================
INTRODUCTION
============================================================================


----------------
BETA INFORMATION
----------------

This edition of ProBoard is a "beta version" to test Y2K compliance with
actual customer systems.

Bug reports should be sent to the senior TeleGrafix engineer at:

        jeff.reeder@telegrafix.com (jreeder@telegrafix.com)

If you send messages to support@telegrafix.com, they might take a bit of
time to reach me.  Do not send messages to anybody at proboard.com.  We're
struggling with Network Solutions to get "proboard.com" moved over to our
server, but there are beurocratic complications that are gumming up the
works.  We don't anticipate that proboard.com will be switched over to our
server for several weeks at the least.  It will probably be well into
January before we get the situation resolved.

It is >critical< that we know if this software works functionally as v2.16
did, with exception to the Y2K fixes.  Obviously if the Y2K fixes are 
broken, we can't upgrade the beta to a release version.  If the Y2K issues
look good, please concentrate your efforts on the basic functionality of the
software.  If it operations the same as v2.16 in all other respects, please
let us know.  There have been other small modifications as noted below that
could affect the beta testing cycle, but they are relatively minor.  The
biggest changes in non-Y2K issues are the changes to the PB SDK for v2.2
compliance.  Turns out that the ProBoard SDK hasn't been updated in many
years.  If we broke something with it, we need to know.  We did create
several PEX modules for testing purposes "in-house", and they worked as they
were supposed to.  From what we know, existing v2.16 compatible PEX modules
shouldn't be affected.

In either event, if something worked in v2.16, but doesn't in v2.2, please
let us know!


-----------
BUG REPORTS
-----------

If you find a Y2K bug, please try to describe every possibly relevant piece
of information about the bug, including what data entry fields don't work
right, what quirky situations bomb-out, or any other relevant information.
Remember, if we can't duplicate the problem, it'll be all that much harder
to fix!

We've made some visual changes to the ProCFG and the main system console.
If you totally hate the new look, we'd appreciate knowing about it.  If you
don't like the new appearance, please take a deep breath and ask yourself,
"is it really offensive?", or is it just "different than what you're used 
to?"

RELEASE INFORMATION
============================================================================


Below, you'll find changes to recent versions of ProBoard.  Each change has
a notation to the left of it which identifes the type of change made to the
software.  Those notations are as follows:

         (-) Means a bug fix.             
         (*) Means a new feature.         
         (%) Means a change.              
         (D) Means a documentation change.


------------------------------
ProBoard v2.20.00 (12/10/1999)
------------------------------

(%) ProBoard now has a new registration scheme.  It no longer uses the 
    REGKEY.PB file to store your registration information.  Now, your
    registration information is burned into the PROBOARD.EXE file itself.
    I know there are going to be a lot of people out there who won't like
    this change in the slightest, but it's really for new customers of
    ProBoard.  With ProBoard v2.2, new customers don't automatically get
    an unlimited node license when they buy a copy.  They purchase the
    number of nodes they want to run.  The key is the serial number and
    the activation code which is used to unlock the software.  This
    information tells ProBoard how many nodes it will allow.  Now, for all
    those people who already own existing copies of ProBoard, you will
    automatically be upgraded to an unlimited node license as part of your
    upgrade.
    
    How do I upgrade to v2.2, and get it registered?  It's a four-step
    process.
    
    Step 1: Download ProBoard v2.2 (which you've already done, or you
            wouldn't be seeing this file).
    
    Step 2: Run the program included with ProBoard 2.2 called REGINFO.EXE.
            This will read your REGKEY.PB file, and extract out the old
            registration information.  It will then display an eight-digit
            code on the screen which is your Upgrade-ID code.  This code
            will be crucial in the next step.
    
    Step 3: Visit the TeleGrafix Web site at http://www.telegrafix.com,
            and purchase your upgrade.  While you're filling out the
            upgrade form, you'll be asked for your Upgrade-ID code, the
            name of the SysOp and the BBS name as they appear in ProCFG.
            The Web site will compare this information against the data
            encoded in your Upgrade-ID code, and if they match, you'll 
            automatically be given your new registration information.
    
            NOTE: A single BBS can only be upgraded once, to prevent pirates
                  from stealing your registration information!
    
    Step 4: Run the REGISTER.EXE program, and key-in the newly assigned
            serial number and activation code.
    
    That's all there is to it.  You're ready to go online with a fully
    functioning ProBoard system.

(%) New look and feel for the main console.

(-) Fixed a minor centering problem in the "last caller" field.
 
(*) Added a new option to the status bar (ALT-J) to "Jump to DOS".  This
    option was already available in the software, but it wasn't documented
    on the main console screen.
  
(*) Added five new functions to the ProBoard PEX SDK:
  
         fileno()
         getcurdir()
         getdisk()
         _dos_getftime()
         _dos_setftime()

(%) Changed message 361 in the language files to make room for the expanded
    year string.

(-) Updated ProCFG.EXE to properly handle four-byte year data entry.  The
    expiration date can be set to "00/00/0000" to indicate no expiration
    date.

(-) The new user signup now allows you to select from the updated date
    formats:
  
       MM/DD/YYYY
       YYYY/MM/DD
       DD/MM/YYYY

(-) The new user signup now forces you to enter four-digit years when asked
    to enter your date of birth.

(-) The file system now forces you to enter four-digit years when entering a
    date to search for files by.

(-) Fixed a potentially serious bug with the birthdate asking code.  There
    were circumstances when it might generate a garbled birthdate.

(*) Added a new macro code to ".A?? File Control Codes".  The new code is
    "^F;" (i.e., 06-59).  This code displays the user's password, or if the
    "Hide Password" option is enabled in ProCFG, then this option will display
    the password hiding character as defined in ProCFG.  
  
(-) The default SETUP.* menu files have been changed to use the new "^F;" 
    macro code instead of "^FC" for the password display to properly support
    the Hide Password option.

(*) Changed the look and feel of the SysOp functions F1 and Shift-F1 to be
    more consistent with the main console appearance.

(%) Changed the color of the status line displayed on the main console when
    a user is logged in.  The new color is more like the main console.

(%) Changed the entire look and feel of ProCFG to be more similar to the BBS
    main console.

(-) Fixed a bug with ProCFG where if you make changes to the system
    configuration data, the inappropriate action was taken when you chose to
    save or cancel the changes when you exit.  I don't know if this was
    present in the release version of v2.16, but in the code obtained from
    the author, the exact opposite operation was performed.  If you decided 
    to abandon the changes, they got saved instead, and vice-versa.

(-) Updated the PB_SDK header, and the library.  Several of the data 
    structures in PB_SDK.H have been updated to be accurate with regard to
    ProBoard v2.2 compatibility.  The .LIB file has also been rebuilt to
    be v2.2 compliant.


---------------------------------------------
ProBoard v2.16 (Changes since ProBoard v2.15)
---------------------------------------------

 NOTE: the new features in this release are not documented in
       PB216.DOC.

(-) When showing GIF file information, the more prompt is now
    displayed correctly.

(*) ProCFG allows you to insert, delete, move and sort message
    areas and file areas.

(*) Menu functions 49 and 54 (Select file and message area), now
    accept a new parameter to set the number of columns to
    display the areas in:

(-) Erasing of the "More Y/N/Tag" prompt should now work ok.

(-) ProBoard would say "No files received" twice after a null
    upload.  This has been fixed.

(-) When editing tagged files, a 'C' would be shown when typing
    a 'U' to untag a single file.  Fixed.

(-) The "inactive for xx seconds" prompt is now only shown once.

(-) Tabs in FILES.BBS are converted to spaces instead of waiting
    for <Enter>.

(*) The color of the letters typed when tagging files is no longer
    hardcoded to yellow.



---------------------------------------------
ProBoard v2.15 (Changes since ProBoard v2.12)
---------------------------------------------

(*) The biggest change in this version is the inclusion of an
    internal fullscreen editor.  It's a stripped down version of
    TheEdit, and it will be distributed with ProBoard free of
    charge and fully functional.  To enable it, you have to
    toggle "Use internal fullscreen editor" in
    ProCFG/Options/Paths.

    (NOTE: if you're using a PEX named FSED.PEX (like TheQuote),
     the internal full-screen editor will NOT work!  Delete
     FSED.PEX from your PEX directory to make it work)

(*) The default language can now be specified.  This is the
    language that will be used to prompt the users for their name
    at login.  It's also used when the user's language is not
    installed.

(*) A semaphore file for shutting down ProBoard is now supported.
    Just create a file called DOWN.#, and ProBoard will exit with
    a specific errorlevel.

(-) When a user's screen length is set to 0, ProBoard no longer
    locks up when listing files.

(*) Default protocols have been implemented.  There's a new menu
    function to change the default protocol.  The user can select
    any protocol or "No default protocol".  3 extra language
    prompts have been added for this feature.

(*) It is now possible to password-protect every menu item (see
    the menu editor)

(%) The default date for the new file check is no longer the date
    of the last call, but the date of the last new file check.

(*) 2 new menu functions have been added: "Change Message Area
    Group" and "Change File Area Group".  This allows users to
    select a new file/msg group without having to select a
    file/msg area.

(*) The functions "Keyword Search", "Filename search" and "New
    file search" now accept a new parameter:
      /FG    Only searches areas in the current file group
      /FG=x  Only searches areas in the specified file group

(*) For each menu item, you can now specify what nodes are
    allowed to access it.

(%) When you only have one language installed, or when all
    languages share the same menus, ProCFG won't ask for a
    language in the menu editor.

(*) The background color for prompts can now be changed.  It's a
    global setting in ProCFG/Options/Display.


---------------------------------------------
ProBoard v2.12 (Changes since ProBoard v2.10)
---------------------------------------------

(-) The installation utility will ask you if you want to
    overwrite your old language files or not.  If you select
    "No", any prompts that are missing in your old language
    files will be updated with the default English prompts that
    come with ProBoard.

(-) The local protocol is no longer selectable when RIP is
    enabled.

(-) The local protocol is no longer selectable in the QWK PEX.

(-) The language editor no longer shows funny characters when
    pressing <PgDn> at the last screen.

(*) When a user logs off, any files that were tagged and not
    downloaded will still be tagged at the next logon.

(%) The maximum number of AKAs has been increased to 50 (used to
    be 20)

(%) The RIP support has been reduced: the internal RIP prompts
    and screens are no longer used by ProBoard.  There were too
    many problems with it.  You can only have RIP MENUS now.

(-) Putting a Ctrl-L in a language prompt no longer messes up the
    screen.

(-) When user's alias and real name are the same, ProBoard
    would sometimes leave the "From" field blank when posting a
    message.  This has been fixed.


---------------------------------------------
ProBoard v2.12 (Changes since ProBoard v2.01)
---------------------------------------------

(*) Modem connect strings have been added for the following baud
    rates:

       1200/75
       21600
       26400
       31200
       33600
       36000
       57600
       64000
       115200

(*) It is now possible to run a PEX or display an ANSI/ASCII file
    in any language prompt.

(*) You can now define up to 6 user-defined baud rates and connect
    strings.

(*) Separate modem configurations for each node are now possible.

(*) New option added to Menu Function 27 (Write a message) to send
    netmail to a specified address/person.

(%) The maximum # of security levels you can specify in ProBoard
    is now 50 instead of 25.

(*) Periods ('.') are now allowed as date seperators, for example,
    06.14.57 is now considered a valid date.

(-) On multi-node systems (running ProBoard standalone, without a
    mailer) sometimes the modem failed to initialize properly or
    would fall asleep while waiting for a call.  This has been
    fixed by sending the initialization commands every 5 minutes.

(*) Uploads can now be scanned for viruses by specifying an
    external upload scanner.  You should be able to integrate any
    available upload scanner into ProBoard.

(*) New Switch in PBUTIL UK.  You can now specify a -L<level>, and
    PBUTIL UK will only work on users with the level you specify.

(-) The CONFIG.RA file created by CONVERT SIMUL2 was sometimes not
    recognized by external utilities because file area names in it
    were being truncated.  This has been fixed.

(%) The QWK offline mail PEX will now update the users lastread
    pointers BEFORE it waits for the user to press <ENTER>.

(-) When compiling a nodelist (using PBUTIL NC), ProBoard would
    display a negative number when the "xxx nodes compiled"
    message was displayed.  This has been fixed.

(%) The field lengths for the Message Areas have been increased.
    The maximum length for an "area name" and "echomail tag" is
    now 80 characters.

(%) All of ProBoard's message area configurations are now stored
    in the file "MESSAGES.PB" instead of, as in previous versions,
    the file "MSGAREAS.PB".  This means that any external
    utilities or programs you have that use the file "MSGAREAS.PB"
    can not be used until they are updated to use the new
    "MESSAGES.PB" file structure.

(%) Any PEX files or doors that use the "MSGAREAS.PB" structure
    will NOT work correctly.  They will have to be recompiled for
    this version to support the new "MESSAGES.PB" file structure!

(%) Any files contained in your file lists (FILES.BBS, etc.) that
    are larger than 1 megabyte, (for example, a 1.4 megabyte
    file), are now displayed as "1.4M" instead of "1400k" when the
    file list is shown to your users.

(%) When a "guest" user (GUEST flag set in their user record) logs
    in, and he/she forgot the password, ProBoard will no longer
    write a warning message.

(%) ProBoard will no longer ask new users to select a language if
    there's only one language file installed.

(*) There is a new option in PROCFG/Options/System Options: "RIP
    Graphics".  When set to "Disabled", ProBoard will not use RIP,
    even if it was detected at login.

(*) ProBoard now allows you to change the colors of your the file
    listings and decide whether or not not you want to display the
    file counters to your users.  (Refer to "PROCFG/Options/File
    List Format" for more details).

(*) ProBoard will now automatically enter the '/' for the users
    when they enter a date.

(*) While editing message/file areas in PROCFG, you can now jump to
    the next or previous message/file area by pressing the <PgUp>
    and <PgDn> keys.

(-) Lastread pointers are now correctly maintained for message
    areas greater than 1,000.

(%) The "CD-ROM" flag in each file area's configuration has been
    removed.  ProBoard will now determine the format of your
    FILES.BBS itself (whether or not the date/time and size are
    listed).  Refer to the PROCFG/FileAreas section of the 2.10
    manual for more information.

(*) A new flag has been added for each file area: "Copy Local".
    When enabled, ProBoard will copy the file to a local directory
    before starting a download.  Refer to the PROCFG/FileAreas
    section of the 2.10 manual for more information.

(*) The time-consuming process of creating the file "TOPS.PRO"
    when the first caller of each new day logs in, has been moved
    to PBUTIL.  As a result, there's a new option in PBUTIL: "DM"
    (Daily Maintenance).  You should run this at least once a day
    (as part of your nightly maintenance).

(*) Menu Function 34 (View Archive) now supports RAR archived
    files.

(*) Handles (Aliases) are now supported in menu functions 13 (List
    Users), 50 (Show Users Online), 51 (Last Callers) and 53
    (MultiLine Chat).

(%) Files listed in "FILES.BBS" can now start with a "!".  ProBoard
    will determine if a line in "FILES.BBS" starting with a "!" is
    a comment or a file name.

(-) PROCFG will no longer lock up the system if you press the
    <DEL> key when there are no entries shown in the Personal
    Files window.

(*) When running ProBoard in standalone mode (without a front-end
    mailer system), when you're at the "waiting for call" screen,
    you can now shell to DOS by pressing <ALT+J>.

(%) The .A?? file control code for the user's address line 2 has
    been changed from ^F% to ^F' (single quote).

(%) The .A?? file control code for the user's country has been
    changed from ^F@ to ^F" (double quote).

(-) When you are replying to netmail from a point address,
    ProBoard now correctly addresses the message to that point
    address.

(%) The file MODEM.PRO has been renamed to MODEM.PB  It is safe to
    delete your old MODEM.PRO file -AFTER- you have run the
    CONVERT PB routine (or the installation utility) as outlined
    in UPGRADE.TXT.

(-) The "In TOPFILES" flag is now saved correctly when editing
    file area configurations.

(-) The "@<LASTDATE>@" and "@<LASTTIME>@" text macros now work
    correctly.

(-) The "Hidden" flag in validation templates now correctly
    toggles the "Hidden" flag in the user record instead of the
    "Deleted" flag.

(-) Files that are not valid .GIF files are not shown when using
    Menu Function 55 (Show .GIF File Info).

(%) The "BEFOREPW.A??" and "AFTERPW.A??" files are now also
    displayed (if they exist) for BBS systems who are NOT using a
    system password.

(-) File counters for files that have been downloaded more than 99
    times, are now displayed properly (alignment) when displaying
    file lists.

(-) The JAM lastread pointers in are now correctly updated when
    running PBUTIL MP (Message Pack).

(%) Users no longer can press <CTRL+G> to make the BBS beep when
    they enter messages using ProBoard's internal message editor.

(*) Personal files can now be sent from directories other than the
    personal files directory as specified in ProCFG.

(*) For every personal file, you can set whether ProBoard will
    delete the file after it has been downloaded or not.

(*) ProCFG now checks if directories you entered exist or not, and
    asks the user if he/she would like to create them.  Paths are
    created multiple levels deep.  For example, if you enter
    "C:\PB\RIP\ICONS", and C:\PB\RIP does not exist,  ProCFG will
    create "C:\PB\RIP" first, and then "C:\PB\RIP\ICONS" !

(*) Menu function 44 (Global boards selection) now accepts the
    parameter "/M" which allows the user to globally
    select/unselect areas for mail check.

(%) For each message area, you can now choose between the
    following for "Name Options":
       * Real Names Only
       * Free Alias
       * Fixed Alias (or real name)
       * Fixed Alias (enforced)

(*) Local Up/Downloads are now supported. (by using the supplied
    PEX file LOC_PROT.PEX)

(%) When searching for files, the area names are now shown on one
    line, unless a match in found in an area.

(*) You can now replace the login procedure with a PEX.  The old
    LOGIN.PEX is no longer supported.
