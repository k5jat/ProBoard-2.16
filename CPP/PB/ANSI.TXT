The following is a list of the ANSI codes.   In the
examples below, ESC is an escape (ASCII 27) and Pn represents an ASCII
integer.  Spaces are shown only for clarity and are not to be inserted.
The special graphics set is supported for charts and graphics (see SCS, SI
and SO).  When ANSI is on the following keys send different sequences:

Cursor Up = ESC [ A

Cursor Down = ESC [ B

Cursor Right = ESC [ C

Cursor Left = ESC [ D

Control-Home = ESC [ 2 J

Example:

ESC [ 5 ; 40 f

The above example will move the cursor to row 5, column 40.


ANSI Code		Meaning
---------		------------------------------------

ESC c			RIS Reset to Initial State

ESC [ Pn A		CUU Cursor UP Pn lines (Default = 1)
ESC [ Pn B		CUD Cursor DOWN Pn lines (Default = 1)
ESC [ Pn C		CUF Cursor RIGHT Pn lines (Default = 1)
ESC [ Pn D		CUB Cursor LEFT Pn lines (Default = 1)

ESC [ Pn ; Pn H		CUP Direct Cursor Position.  Uses the form Row, Column.
			Home is position 1,1.  If no parameters are given, the
			cursor is moved to the home position

ESC [ Pn ; Pn f		HVP Horizontal and Vertical Position.
			(Same as ESC [ Pn ; Pn H)

ESC [ s			Save Cursor Position.
ESC 7			Save Cursor Position.

ESC [ u			Restore Cursor Position.
ESC 8			Restore Cursor Position.

ESC [ Pn J		ED Erase in Display.

		 	Pn = 0	Erase from active position to the end
				of the screen, inclusive (default).
			     1	Erase from start of the screen to the
				active position, inclusive.
			     2	Erase all of the display.  The cursor
				does not move.

ESC [ Pn K		EL Erase in Line.

			 Pn = 0	Erase from active position to the end of line,
				inclusive (default).
			      1	Erase from start of the screen to the active
				position, inclusive.
			      2	Erase all of the line, inclusive.

ESC [ Pn ;...; Pn m	SGR Select Graphics Rendition.

			 Pn = 0	Attributes off
			      1	Bold or increased intensity
			      4	Underscore
			      5	Blink
			      7	Reverse


WHAT ARE YOU?

	Invoked by	ESC [ c
			 or
			ESC [ 0 c

	Response is	ESC [ ? 1 ; 2 c   (VT100 with AVO)



CURSOR REPORT

	Invoked by	ESC [ 6 n

	Response is	ESC [ Pl ; Pc R   (row and column of cursor)

	Where		Pl = row
			Pc = column


STATUS REPORT

	Invoked by	ESC [ 5 n

	Response is	ESC [ 0 n   (terminal is ok)



SCS Select Character Set

	G0 Set		G1 Set

	ESC (A		ESC )A		United Kingdom Set
	ESC (B		ESC )B		ASCII Set (default)
	ESC (0		ESC )0		Special Graphics
	ESC (1		ESC )1		Same as ASCII Set
	ESC (2		ESC )2		Same as Special Graphics



Control		Decimal
Char		Code		Action taken
-------		-------		------------
SO		14		Invoke G1 character set (See SCS Above)
SI		15		Invoke G0 character set
XOFF		17		Causes terminal to stop sending
XON		19		Re-Start data after an XOFF (See FLOW command)
